# Movie Recommender System

This project implements a movie recommendation system, likely leveraging machine learning techniques to suggest movies to users based on various criteria.

## Features (Assumed)

*   **Content-Based Filtering:** Recommends movies similar to ones the user has liked, based on attributes like genre, cast, crew, and keywords.
*   **Data Processing:** Utilizes movie datasets (e.g., TMDB 5000) for cleaning, transformation, and feature engineering.
*   **Similarity Calculation:** Employs techniques (e.g., cosine similarity) to determine the likeness between movies.
*   **Interactive Interface:** (Potentially) An IPython Notebook (`movie.ipynb`) for exploration, model training, and demonstrating recommendations.

## Setup and Installation

To get this project up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

### Prerequisites

*   Python 3.x
*   Jupyter Notebook (or Jupyter Lab)
*   Git (for cloning the repository)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ChaturvedyShalini/movie_recommendar_system.git
    cd movie_recommendar_system
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required Python packages:**
    (You might need to create a `requirements.txt` if one doesn't exist, by inspecting `movie.ipynb` for imports)
    ```bash
    pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn jupyter
    ```
    *Note: The exact libraries might vary. Please check `movie.ipynb` for all imported libraries and install them.*

## Usage

1.  **Start Jupyter Notebook:**
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

2.  **Open `movie.ipynb`:**
    Navigate to and open the `movie.ipynb` file in your browser-based Jupyter interface.

3.  **Run the Notebook:**
    Execute the cells in the notebook sequentially to preprocess the data, build the recommendation model, and generate movie recommendations.

## Data Sources

This project uses datasets from The Movie Database (TMDB):

*   `tmdb_5000_credits.csv`: Contains information about movie cast and crew.
*   `tmdb_5000_movies.csv`: Contains detailed information about movies, including genres, keywords, overview, etc.

Additionally, preprocessed data might be stored in:

*   `movies.pkl`: Pickled Python object, likely containing processed movie data.
*   `movies_dict.pkl`: Pickled Python dictionary, possibly mapping movie IDs to titles or other metadata.
*   `similarity.pkl` (if present and used): Pickled similarity matrix used for recommendations.
